This is the game, Entangled, a mode 4 GameBoy game.

The goal of the game is to survive all 40 levels to the end. Move your player left and right on the lines. You can only move on the three lines specified!

The entire game is based loosely off of gameplay mechanics in Undertale, a game developed by Toby Fox. Music for this game is based off of music from Undertale, composed by Toby Fox. 8-Bit mixing was done by myself, while conversion into C was done with the help of the program, GBATracker.

In case the levels are too difficult, you can use the following buttons to seed yourself to a level.

1. Hold R, press START: Seeded to level 10 (Non-random spider patterns start appearing around here)
2. Hold B, press START: Seeded to level 20 (Bullets not moving on the line appear here)
3. Hold UP, press START: Seeded to level 30 (Lasers of all types!)
4. Hold RIGHT, press START: Seeded to level 40 (The final stage)
5. Hold DOWN, press START: Seeded to the cutscene before the victory screen. (You cheater)
